## Enable the Service Worker

```yaml
params:
  serviceWorker: "precache"
```

SeoTax registers a service worker and precaches generated assets
when this option is enabled.

## Deployment Notes

Test caching on a deployed HTTPS site.
When you change assets or service-worker behavior,
use a new build and verify updates in the browser's Application panel.
